# Lane Detection using FCN (VGG-16)
Hi, I am going to build a model to segment road lanes using VGG-16. 

Computer vision is solving various problem in the field of AI, Easing life of industries by solving & easing up the tiresome tasks. Semantic Segmentation is one of the important topic in the field of self-driving. It paves the way towards complete scene of understanding the surroundings. 
Semantic segmentation is widely divided into three steps, Those are Classification, Localization, Finally Semantic segmenation.
